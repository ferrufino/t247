**About this meeting**

_With the client:_

* The client mentioned that one of the biggest issues is the communication between the back end and the front end, the flow of information between those is really slow, we need to improve that.
* It's important to maintain security, control that user cannot inject malicious code
* Develop the "Verify tool" -> Student can use this tool to check custom test cases and see which is the correct answer
* Right now the platform "Tutoring 24/7" is working with Vagrant (https://www.vagrantup.com/)
* The client REQUIRES that the supported languages are Java and C++
* It's important to have in mind that the "Tutoring 24/7" platform must not be considered as an "Online Judge", our platform should be able to give feedback to the student, that feedback can be generated according to the errors of the student, however, it's important to not tell the student which case was incorrect, for example:

              
        Wrong feedback
            Input: -5
            Expected output: 25
            Actual output: -25

        Good feedback
            "Incorrect solution: check solution of the problem when negative numbers are used as input"
             

    * We must make the decision if the student will write a full solution, including main function, includes, etc (Like COJ) OR if the student just needs to write a function (Like Leetcode).


_After the meeting with the client:_

* Waffle issues where updated, please check this link to see if you have any assigment (https://waffle.io/ferrufino/t247)
* We talked about different solutions, frameworks to develop T247, one of the proposals is "Spring Java", the other one is using Python, we still need to decide which one to use.
* Gustavo and Eduardo completed the setup for Slack
* We considered using Phoenix framework (http://www.phoenixframework.org/)
* Alfredo created a Doodle survey in order to know the free hours of the team members to arrange the next meeting.
